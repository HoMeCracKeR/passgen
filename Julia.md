Porting to Julia attempts to fix the speed issues found in python as of this writing The julia port out performs python by a huge margin
Julia - lowercase at 10 character length = 253,301K/s
Python - lowercase at 10 character length = 92,135K/s

Obviously with these results we see that Julia is a superior language in terms of speed, I am expecting a full port to be finished
within the month. Check back for more.
